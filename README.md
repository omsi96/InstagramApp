# InstagramApp
This app will show you how to restructure your code using MVC architecture.Where MVC means: (Model) (View) (Contorller) <br> 
You can research about MVC to understand how things should work.<br>

We introduced Networking layer in this app, to provide level of abstraction when using the internal apis. So you can easily read the code. <br>

**Rule of thumb**: 
Controllers should handle the view interactions. Should not structure data. Should take data from Models and view it in the views.
